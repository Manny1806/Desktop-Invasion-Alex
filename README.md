# Desktop-Invasion-Alex
This is a space invaders type game I made using Python3 and Pygame

## Description
Your Windows 95 desktop has become overrun with old and unused desktop shortcuts!
It's up to you to blast them from the desktop before they invade the taskbar!

The game features my own original chiptune music made using an original NES!

## Installation
-Download and clone git
-Install Python3
-Install Pygame

## How to play
When the game starts there will be a start button at the middle of the screen.

Press the button to start playing!

Use the left and right keys to move your Recycle Ship

Use spacebar to shoot your recycle bullets

If the shortcuts touch your recycle ship or the bottom of the screen you lose a life.
Dont worry though, you start the game with 3 extra lives.

Each time you win a round the movement speed of the shortcuts will increase, making it 
increasingly difficult.

See how many points you can rack up before game over! 

## One last thing..

Watch out for clippy!!!
